# Data-Science

In the Final Assignment - Python for Data Science I uploaded, I used Python libraries: NumPy, Pandas, and Matplotlib to import information from 
the web links. 

I also saved the Dataframe as a CSV file and created a link to share the file. 

I visualized data using Python Visualization libraries: Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Folium
